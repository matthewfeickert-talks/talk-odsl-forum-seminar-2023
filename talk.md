# Talk Notes

* **Abstract**: Scientific analysis is driven forward by software, which is often created and developed by the same scientists performing the analysis. As the expected skill set breadth of the modern scientist continues to grow with the rapid progress of computational techniques, the challenge of productionizing scripts and examples into robust and reusable computational tools can be daunting. This seminar will provide best practice resources, motivating examples, and demonstrations for how scientists can transform real world analyses into reusable, publicly distributed scientific tools using modern open source tool chains. The focus will be on the scientific Python ecosystem and build tools, but will include demonstrations of Pythonic bindings to C++ tooling as well as examples from the Julia community.
* **Talk time**: 30 to 45 minutes

* Following recommendations of [Daniel Katz's CHEP 2018 presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/587955/contributions/3012261/)

   - Cite the software, and if there's a paper for the software cite that too
* Analysts are still adopting this habit and need reminding

# Recommendations from Journals and Publishers
.huge[

   - Publishers can .bold[better instruct editors and referees] what publishers expect from them
* .bold[Journal of Open Source Software]
   - In addition to incentivizing high quality software, JOSS can help .bold[[bridge the gap](https://joss.theoj.org/about)]

# Recommendations: CITATION.cff

.kol-3-5.large[
- Adopt the [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) as a common standard and add a `CITATION.cff` to project repository
   - Human- and machine-readable file format in YAML
   - Has well defined, versioned schema
   - Convertible to other citation formats (BibTeX, CodeMeta, EndNote, RIS, schema.org, Zenodo, APA)
- Supported by [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files), [Zenodo](https://twitter.com/ZENODO_ORG/status/1420357001490706442), and [Zotero](https://twitter.com/zotero/status/1420515377390530560)!
- [Web tool initializer](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/) for easily creating first `CITATION.cff`
- [Tooling for validation](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-converter-python)

   - Version control repository README
   - Online software documentation (landing page, how to cite page)
   - Package distribution websites (e.g. PyPI)
- Have .bold[single source of truth] for citations: version control repository that all other sources derive from.
- Make your .bold[citation preferences clear] to the world and SEO. Do not rely on people emailing to ask (they shouldn't have to).

# Revisiting Software Citation Principles in HEP

.large[
* .bold.large[Importance:] As a field HEP understands software is important, but improvements could be made on views towards research products
* .bold.large[Credit and Attribution:] Improving in HEP, but can leverage software friendly journals (i.e., JOSS) to help this
* .bold.large[Unique Identification:] Zenodo DOIs are common to HEP. CITATION.cff files can help as well.
* .bold.large[Persistence:] Long term archival through Zenodo is common practice
* .bold.large[Accessibility:] HEP is becoming more [FAIR](https://fair4hep.github.io/) focused. CITATION.cff provides common framework for metadata. Further support of INSPIRE by field could provide strong database access.
* .bold.large[Specificity:] Include version numbers in CITATION.cff

# Summary

.huge[
* Software citation is an .bold[ongoing process] that is not straightforward (for any scientific field)
* Differing community .bold[processes and standards] exist in HEP (we've never been homogeneous)
* Agreement that more citation is probably useful and .bold[programatic discovery] of citations is important

# CITATION.cff: Which DOIs?

Personal choice, but given specific release DOIs are generated .italic[after] the release is made to have the versioned and distributed `CITATION.cff` be correct at release would recommend the Zenodo project level ("cite all versions") DOI.

# CITATION.cff: How to keep up to date?

.large[
- As plain text, very easy to update version information when cutting a release
- Can use tool control of version update to make it easier
   - Example: [`tbump`](https://github.com/your-tools/tbump)
   - `$ tbump <version target>`
- Also possible to have [automated version bump workflows](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf/blob/d9355e23ffd4aceb24041c51c697a55fa40a3d94/.github/workflows/bump-version.yml) using continuous integration
- (Jumping ahead a slide) What about the Zenodo DOI?
   - For simplicity, use the project level DOI and not the version level DOI

# Zenodo: DOI minting made easy

- Everything on Zenodo has a DOI
   - Provides both a .bold[project] DOI (resolves to latest) and .bold[version specific] DOI
- Enable it to [automatically preserve work from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) (can also directly upload, but lose out on automation)
   - Benefit from having a DOI for .bold[every version] regardless of software paper landscape state
- Once you have a DOI, put it .bold[everywhere] (again)
   - Recommend sharing the project DOI and letting users select a specific version if they want it
